# Diabetic-Retinopathy-Detection

## Problem Statement

Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a severe eye disease that affects millions of people globally. It arises as a complication of uncontrolled blood sugar levels in individuals with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Left untreated, DR can lead to irreversible vision loss and even blindness. The project aims to leverage the capabilities of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Deep Learning to develop an accurate and efficient model for early detection of DR from retinal images.

Project Goals:
Detection Accuracy: Train a deep neural network model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Residual Blocks to accurately classify retinal images into different stages of DR.
Early Intervention: Enable doctors to identify DR before it progresses to irreversible stages, allowing timely intervention and prevention of blindness.
Scalability: Create a scalable solution that can handle a large volume of retinal images efficiently, making it practical for widespread clinical use.

Significance:
The project has the potential to revolutionize DR diagnosis by providing an automated, reliable, and rapid screening tool. By detecting DR early, we can significantly improve patient outcomes and reduce the burden on healthcare systems.
